# Zombie Free Zone

Zombie Free Zone is an educational digital media literacy game designed to help children aged 9-12 build essential skills for navigating today’s digital landscape. As kids of this age are increasingly curious about social media, this project taps into that interest with a social-media-inspired interface and gameplay, offering them a safe, engaging way to develop critical thinking skills and identify misinformation.

## Project Mission
In a world where AI-generated content, deep fakes, and misinformation abound, Zombie Free Zone aims to arm kids with the ability to distinguish real from fake. The project encourages active, critical engagement with digital content rather than passive consumption—a skill set we believe every young internet user should have.

## Gameplay and Storytelling
In Zombie Free Zone, players navigate through a series of posts that mimic the style of social media news feeds, making it relatable and exciting for young users. Players encounter fictional headlines and must decide if they’re true, exaggerated, or entirely fake. The game’s narrative introduces a fun yet important concept: people who mindlessly consume and follow fake news are transformed into “zombies.” The player's role is to spot misinformation and reawaken their own critical thinking to stay “zombie-free” and help others “reactivate their brains” as well.

## Key Features
- Social Media Style: The game simulates social media feeds, providing kids with a familiar environment that resonates with their curiosity about social platforms.
- Story-driven Critical Thinking: Through the “zombie” narrative, kids are encouraged to question exaggerated claims, analyze their gut reactions, and consider how different content makes them feel—all while they progress in the game.
- Progressive Challenges: Similar to language-learning apps, Zombie Free Zone awards badges and increases difficulty as players improve, helping them to develop and retain their fact-checking skills.

### Educational Impact
Zombie Free Zone is built with input from media literacy experts to support educators and parents in teaching children critical thinking skills. It offers a hands-on, engaging way to address the issue of misinformation with students in a classroom or homeschooling environment. By shifting from passive consumption to active verification, we aim to build resilience in young users against the risks of misinformation.
