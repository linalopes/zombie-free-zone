    <!-- First Section: Intuition -->
    <section class="container my-5 text-center toolkit-step">
        <h2>Step 1: What's Your First Intuition?</h2>
        <p>Read the headline. Does it feel trustworthy? Does it seem like it might be false? Trust your first instinct. How does it make you feel?</p>

    <!-- Second Section: Emotions -->
    <section class="container my-5 text-center toolkit-step">
        <h2>Step 2: How Does It Make You Feel?</h2>
        <p>Does the news bring up strong emotions in you, like anger or excitement? Sometimes, news tries to use emotions to make us feel a certain way. Should we be suspicious when news tries to control our feelings?</p>

    <!-- Third Section: Exaggeration -->
    <section class="container my-5 text-center toolkit-step">
        <h2>Step 3: Does It Feel Exaggerated?</h2>
        <p>Look for clues. Does it sound too dramatic? News that uses extreme language can often be "clickbait" or fake. Statistics show that <strong>X%</strong> of exaggerated news stories are actually fake. What do you think about this one?</p>

    <!-- Fourth Section: Objectivity -->
    <section class="container my-5 text-center toolkit-step">
        <h2>Step 4: Is There a Clear Message?</h2>
        <p>Does the news provide clear, objective information? Or is it trying to push an opinion? Sometimes, if there’s too much opinion, we need to look again.</p>

    <!-- Fifth Section: Desire and Motivation -->
    <section class="container my-5 text-center toolkit-step">
        <h2>Step 5: Is It Trying to Sell You Something?</h2>
        <p>Does the news make you want something? Maybe a product or lifestyle? Be cautious—news that plays on our desires might be more of an ad than true information.</p>
